- since modules can't do inports, need to have a build system
   that builds the actual modules from seperate files
    - read the current uploader.json and produce the action and library module
    - also have a mechinism for includeing arbitrary but idiomatic python to 
        collect arbitrary facts.
- run the ansible module testing thing
- test with ansible devel branch and ansible shipped on RHEL
- need to be sure that all the imports used are just from the standard
   python library
  - virtualenv
- add comparison to last run to test.sh
- add comparison of 'skipped' to test.sh
- add standard testing across the board
- fix documentation for both modules
- fact name should be based on spec name, not archive file name
- fix _make_sed_cmd to check if default_sed_file exists, use it if it does,
     but use constant command line if it does not     
- split into two differently named modules
  - come up with names for both modules
  - one collects but doesn't send to red hat
     this one only outputs collected facts
  - one runs the collector and sends to red hat
     this one outputs collected facts, but also the rule results
     returned as facts
- default_ca_file (and anything that uses it)
  This file contains a cert that the client uses to verify that the server is valid.
  We currently set it to false which means that the client doesn't verify the server.
  Instead we should check to see if the cert exists on the control machine, and
  verify the server if it exists.
- figure out what to do about rhsm cert
  - what do other bits of software do, what does the RHSM documentation say to do
     - is the rhsm cert only for use on registered machines or can one get an rhsm cert
       for an organization that can be installed anywhere in an organization and used
       for commuinicating with the portal?
  - the current client calls into some rhsm supplied code to get the names of
    two files that it passes on to the http request code
- handle 'pre-commands' 
- move do_upload failure messages out of log and into Ansible failure results
- move do_upload results out of 'log' and into returned facts
- rewrite 'test_connection' to return results in stderr (or stderr)
- figure out what to do about logging during fact collection
  - the current collector does a lot of logging during collection, while collection
    commands are running, and then ships that log back with the archive.
    So during fact collection, log stuff to ansible normally, and then capture those
    logs in the action_plugin, and put them in the archive.
- get rid of the ansible_main vs main in library/main
- output collected facts as well as rule results
- take config information from module options
   - correct the ansible argument parser in library
- auto register and auto create systems
    (re-verifiy that we don't have to worry duplicate UUIDs)
- handle sat5 branch_info
- specs black/white lists
   - honor existing black/white lists on individual hosts
   - have a mechinism for black/white list in ansible (on control machine)
